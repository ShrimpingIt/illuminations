# Testing Rig

Parts:

- A red wire with crocodile clip
- A black wire with crocodile clip
- A [voltage regulator](#voltage-regulator)
- Optionally - 5V USB adaptor and USB power cable

To power a chain of LEDs in an illumination you need to connect black (0V) and red (2.7V) wires the correct way round to light the piece.

To help with this, we often attach red and black crocodile clips as the 2.7V regulated wires coming out of a [voltage regulator](#voltage-regulator). After attaching the other end of this testing rig to a 5V supply, (e.g. a Mobile phone charger) you can use the crocodile clips to light up the chains one by one by clipping onto the wires trailing from the illumination. This checks the chain is working and proves which way round the red and black wires should be connected.
