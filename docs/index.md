# Morecambe Mini Illuminations

[@ShrimpingIt](www.shrimping.it) have just completed a second year of community workshops at [our base](https://www.theexchangecic.co.uk/steeple-for-the-people) in the West End of Morecambe.

This is intended to summarise the crafting, wiring and coding process for the three different kinds of illuminations shown at [Light Up Lancaster](http://lightuplancaster.co.uk/)

* No dark colours
* Heatshrink crimps and tools
* Spring clip bus 
* Wire colors


Thanks to the support of our [sponsors](#sponsors)
